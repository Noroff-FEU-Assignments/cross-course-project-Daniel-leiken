        Steps to eliminate web security threats on your website:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Network security</b>
        <br>
        Start with eliminating network-threats, I would recommend them to run their site on a trusted hosting-provider and protect their site with Cloudflare as this will also reflect positive on their website performance.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Third-party application</b>
        <br>
        I will recommend to use Detectify/Pentest-Tools to scan and monitor your websites vulnerablilities, as this covers every potential security issue they may have.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Cross-site scripting</b>
        <br>
        Using the default XSS protection if the site is made with React and creating integrity checks on external scripts.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Implementation of automatic user timeout</b>
        <br>
        Set a pre-defined time where the application automatically logs the user out of the website.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>2-factor authentication</b>
        <br>
        Setting a 2FA for users on the website to secure their authorization method, this can be done with Detectify.
        <br>
        <br>
        When finished setting up the web security practices above, I would recommend to run through a check for vulnerablilities in dependencies.
